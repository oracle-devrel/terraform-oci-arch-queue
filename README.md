## Introduction
This repository contains the code and instructions to create and run an OCI Queue demo that runs a consumer that can autoscale on Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE), a demo producer that you can run anywhere(Local Desktop/Virtual Machine), and an OCI Function that provides queue depth for the autoscaling of queue consumers with KEDA.

An overview video and demo video is available [here](https://youtu.be/4RMA_EMjyfo) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC3h9LmKgGY).

This document walks through the build and deployment necessary to configure the demo. Each part of the demo has a readme file explaining how to build and deploy the components in the demo. Which can be found at:

- <a href="https://github.com/oracle-devrel/terraform-oci-arch-queue">Terraforn Repo</a> that can be used to setup the complete solution in your tenancy. As Producer can be executed from your local laptop/ VM instance etc. so it can be done manually after capturing output parameters for Queue OCID and DP endpoint from Resource manager output.
- [Producer](./local-producer/readme.md)


## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

- Permission to `manage` the following types of resources in your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy: `vcns`, `internet-gateways`, `route-tables`, `network-security-groups`, `subnets`, `OKE`, `functions` , `api gateway` and `Queue`.
- Quota to create all of these services  


### Deployment

- <a href="https://github.com/oracle-devrel/terraform-oci-arch-queue">Terraforn Repo</a> that can be used to setup the complete solution in your tenancy. As Producer can be executed from your local laptop/ VM instance etc. so it can be done manually after capturing output parameters for Queue OCID and DP endpoint from Resource manager output.
- [Producer](./local-producer/readme.md)

##### Execution

With the services deployed and configured along with our [Consumer](./oke-consumer/readme.md) and [Queue Depth function](./queue-length-function/readme.md). Execution is simply a case of running one of the scripts provided by the [Producer](./local-producer/readme.md).

#### Observing queue production and consumption

<<<<<<< HEAD
As observing how the different elements execute is unique to that element, the readme documentation for those elements describes how you can see them work. Please check the demo links [here](https://youtu.be/4RMA_EMjyfo) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC3h9LmKgGY) to get more clarity.

3. Select the region where you want to deploy the stack.
   
4. Follow the on-screen prompts and instructions to create the stack.

5. After creating the stack, click **Terraform Actions**, and select **Plan**.

6. Wait for the job to be completed, and review the plan.

    To make any changes, return to the Stack Details page, click **Edit Stack**, and make the required changes. Then, run the **Plan** action again.

7. If no further changes are necessary, return to the Stack Details page, click **Terraform Actions**, and select **Apply**. 

## Validate the Deployment

- Post the infra deployment, note down `queue_dpendpoint` , `queue_ocid` (part of the resource manager job logs/output) to use it as part of Producer. For more details github link of  <a href="https://github.com/oracle-devrel/oci-arch-queue-oke-demo/blob/main/local-producer/readme.md">Producer</a>
- A sample stack output will be as below

```java
Outputs:
deployed_oke_kubernetes_version = "v1.26.2"
deployed_to_region = "ap-tokyo-1"
dev = "Made with ‚ù§ by Oracle Developers"
kubeconfig_for_kubectl = "export KUBECONFIG=./generated/kubeconfig"
ocir_name = "container_repo"
ocir_ocid = "ocid1.containerrepo.oc1......"
queue_dpendpoint = "https://cell-1.queue.messaging.ap-tokyo-1.oci.oraclecloud.com"
queue_ocid = "ocid1.queue.oc1.ap-tokyo-1...." 
```
## Deploy Using the Terraform CLI

### Clone the Module
Now, you'll want a local copy of this repo. You can make that with the commands:

    git clone https://github.com/anilcourse/terraform-oci-arch-queue.git
    cd terraform-oci-arch-queue
    ls

### Set Up and Configure Terraform

1. Complete the prerequisites described [here](https://github.com/cloud-partners/oci-prerequisites).

2. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file, and specify the following variables:

```
# Authentication
tenancy_ocid         = "<tenancy_ocid>"
current_user_ocid    = "<user_ocid>"
fingerprint          = "<finger_print>"
private_key_path     = "<pem_private_key_path>"

# Region
region = "<oci_region>"

# Compartment
compartment_ocid = "<compartment_ocid>"

# OCIR credentials
ocir_user_name = "<user_name>"
ocir_user_password = "<auth_code of the user>"

````

### Create the Resources
Run the following commands:

    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply

### Destroy the Deployment
When you no longer need the deployment, you can run this command to destroy the resources:

    terraform destroy
